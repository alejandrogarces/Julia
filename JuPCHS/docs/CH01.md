# Defining Port-Controlled Hamiltonian Systems
Any port-controlled Hamiltonian system is defined by 

The main object in JuPCHS is the defined by the following structure: 

    mutable struct typePCHS    
        J::Function        # Matrix function (interconnection)
        R::Function        # Matrix function (damping)
        dH::Function       # Vector function (derivative of H)
        H::Function        # Real function (Hamiltonian)
        G::Function        # Vector function (input matrix)
        nx :: Int64        # Number of state variables
        nu :: Int64        # Number of inputs and outputs
        dt :: Float64      # Discretization time
        xlabel :: Vector   # Names of state variables
        ulabel :: Vector   # Names of the inputs
        ylabel :: Vector   # Names of the outputs 
        name::String       # Name of the entire system
    end

The function BuildPCHS creates a port-hamiltonian system with default values:

    S1 = BuildPCHS()

This simple model creates an empty system $\dot{x}=0$.  The command println returns a reduced version with only the most relevant information:

    println(S1)

namely:

    ðŸ“Œ build_PHS (Port Controlled Hamiltonian System)
                  x' = (J(x)-R(x))âˆ‡H(x) + G(x)u(x)
    State variables:        [x1]
    Inputs:                 [u1]
    Outputs:                [y1]
    Discretization time:    1.0e-6



We can add entries such as H, dH, J, R, G, as follows:

    S1 = BuildPCHS(nx=2,nu=1, H=Hs, dH=dHs, J=Js, R=Rs, G=Gs)    

where $H_s$, $\nabla H_s$, $J_s$, $R_s$ are specific entries for defining the model. If one of these entries are leaved empty, then the function assumes values equal to zero, with the correct size, taken from $n_x$ and $n_u$.  

Entries J, H, dH and G are functions that can be evaluated, for example:

    x0 = rand(S1.nx)
    println(S1.J(x0))

However, the function is very flexible, it is possible to introduce a constant matrix as input.  JuPCHS makes the corresponding function:
    
    J = [0 1;-1 0]
    S1 = BuildPCHS(nx=2,J=J)

Then, S1 creates a constant function for the entry S1.J, that is to say, S1.J is a function that requires an input, namely, S1.J(x0) will return the same matrix regarless the value of x0.

In the most general case, we can use a function, namely:

    J = x -> [0 x;-x 0]
    S1 = BuildPCHS(nx=2,J=J)

If J is leaved empty, then the function assumes J=[0 0; 0 0] for this case in which $n_x = 2$.  

Labels are numbered by default as [x1,x2, ..., xn] for the states, [u1,u2, ..., um] for the output, [y1,y2, ..., ym] and, for the outputs.  These values are used for the display options but does not affect the mathematical operations.  The user can introduce customized values which remains after parallel and feedback operations.  

A new PCHS can be created as the interconnection of two or more PCHS previously defined.  See [>> Interconnection of PHCS](CH02.md)
