## Finding a minimum of the Hamiltonian

The minumum point of the Hamiltonian is relevant in several analysis, including stability and passivity analysis.  JuPCHS has a function to solve numerically this problem by using the conjugate gradient method.  The sintaxis is the following

    hm = Hmin(S,xini)

where, **S** is a PCHS and **xini** is an initial condition. The function can be also called without initial condition:

    hm = Hmin(S)

In that case, we assume xini = 0.
